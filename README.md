# Yandex_algorithms_handbook
Welcome. The repo contains my own solutions in C++ for problems from the Yandex handbook on algorithms. Iâ€™m sharing solutions, maybe this will allow you to improve your code. I am also confident that my solutions can be optimized, I am looking for ideas to improve my code.
