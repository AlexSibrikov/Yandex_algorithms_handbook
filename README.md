# Yandex_algorithms_handbook
Welcome. This repo contains my own solutions in C++ for problems from the Yandex handbook on algorithms. Use is intended for educational purposes. Maybe this will help you to find ideas or to optimize your code. I am also confident that my solutions are far from the ideal and can be optimized, will be appreciate for ideas for my code improvement.
